# Altmetric Technical Exercises

In this directory, you will find two exercises:

* 01-problem: a programming exercise with some source data and a README;
* 02-refactoring: a refactoring exercise involving some existing code in need
  of improvement with a passing test suite but details of a bug in a README.

There is no time limit but each exercise should take no longer than an hour or
two.

Please feel free to use any external libraries you wish (though hopefully none
of the exercises should require much beyond the core libraries and any testing
frameworks you might want to use).
